Places to visit: Done by Regan

1. Pier A Park
    This giant, football field-sized park is an urban 
    oasis for city-dwellers. Easily accessible by foot, 
    bike and public transportation, Pier A Park is 
    famous for its waterfront location, incredible 
    views of the city and wide open green space that’s 
    perfect for sunny days.

2. Hudson River Waterfront Walkway
    Doing just about anything, from running to walking, 
    to bike riding or taking your pup out for a stroll 
    on the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is fun. The 
    long path runs parallel to the Hudson River and gives 
    you the option to visit one of Hoboken’s parks and 
    piers along the way. The piéce de résistance is the 
    panoramic view of the city skyline that you get all 
    the way from the north to the south end of the city.
    
3. Washington Street
    Located just one street away from Stevens Institute 
    of Technology, it has a wide variety of stores and
    restaurants. If you want to buy or eat something simple,
    chances are you can buy it on Washington Street. It also
    hosts the annual Hoboken Arts and Music festival and the 
    Italian Festival.
    
4. Stevens Institute of Technology
     Visit the local university! This school is located 
     on 1 Castle Point Avenue. It has a fairly small campus.
     The university boasts a magnificent view of the Manhattan
     skyline, from the 1 World Trade Center to the buildings 
     in front of Times Square. If you have a pre-college 
     kid, you could visit and consider this university!
     If you're a graduate, come visit this school again!
